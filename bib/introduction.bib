abstract = {Context: Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor reflecting technical compromises that can yield short-term benefit but may hurt the long-term health of a software system. Objective: This work aims at collecting studies on TD and TD management (TDM), and making a classification and thematic analysis on these studies, to obtain a comprehensive understanding on the TD concept and an overview on the current state of research on TDM. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to identify and analyze research on TD and its management, covering publications between 1992 and 2013. Results: Ninety-four studies were finally selected. TD was classified into 10 types, 8 TDM activities were identified, and 29 tools for TDM were collected. Conclusions: The term "debt" has been used in different ways by different people, which leads to ambiguous interpretation of the term. Code-related TD and its management have gained the most attention. There is a need formore empirical studieswith high-quality evidence on thewhole TDM process and on the application of specific TDM approaches in industrial settings. Moreover, dedicated TDM tools are needed for managing various types of TD in the whole TDM process.},

This paper describes the outcome of an exploratory study in which 26 industrial practitioners were interviewed on what makes a software system a legacy system, what the main drivers are that lead to the modernization of such systems, and what challenges are faced during the modernization process. The findings of the interviews have been validated by means of a survey with 198 respondents. The results show that practitioners value their legacy systems highly, the challenges they face are not just technical, but also include business and organizational aspects.},

abstract = {This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer project carried out in coopera- tion between the University of Salerno and a small software company. The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrial partner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacy systems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of the partner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decompos- ability with spaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the user interface descriptions. For this reason, it was decided to adopt an incremental migration strategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology, on the transformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs, and the wrapping of the legacy programs. A middleware framework links the new Web-based user interface with the Wrapped Legacy System. An Eclipse plug-in, named MELIS (migration environment for legacy information systems), was also developed to support the migration process. Both the migration strategy and the tool have been applied to two essential subsystems of the most business critical legacy system of the partner company.

abstract = {Cloud computing is a technology that enables elastic, on-demand resource provisioning, allowing appli- cation developers to build highly scalable systems. Multi-tenancy, the hosting of multiple customers by a single application instance, leads to improved efficiency, improved scalability, and less costs. While these technologies make it possible to create many new applications, legacy applications can also benefit from the added flexibility and cost savings of cloud computing and multi-tenancy. In this article, we describe the steps required to migrate existing applications to a public cloud environment, and the steps required to add multi-tenancy to these applications. We present a generic approach and verify this approach by means of two case studies, a commercial medical communications software package mainly used within hospitals for nurse call systems and a schedule planner for managing medical appointments. Both case studies are subject to stringent security and performance constraints, which need to be taken into account during the migration. In our evaluation, we estimate the required investment costs and compare them to the long-term benefits of the migration. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 JohnWiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

However, a migration process entails costs and risks that depend on the characteristics of both the architecture of the source system and the target client-server platform. We propose an approach to program decomposition as a preliminary step for the migration of legacy systems. A program slicing algorithm is defined to identify the statements implementing the user interface component. An interactive re-engineering tool is also presented that supports the software engineer in the comprehension of the source code during the decomposition of a program. The focus of this paper is on the partition of a legacy system, while issues related to the re-engineering, encapsulation, and wrapping of the legacy components and to the definition of the middleware layer through which they communicate are not tackled.},

In order to make full use of those data, many research efforts have been carried out on transformation of relational schema to semantic web, most of which disregard some constraints. This paper presents a set of mappings that transform relational data and schema to semantic web models that preserve constraints. Data is presented in RDF; OWL and SWRL are used to express constraints' satisfaction or validation conditions; and the SPARQL query is used to verify these constraints. A prototype transformation system is designed and implemented based on Jena. Experimental results show that the system can not only successfully translate relational schema into OWL model, but also find out the violation statements when illegal modifications to the OWL model are made.},

Nevertheless, many companies want to reduce operating expenses, to make scalable applications that use cloud computing technologies. Use of NoSQL database is one of the possible solutions, and it is forecasted that the NoSQL market will be growing at a CAGR of approximately 50 percent over the next five years. The paper offers a solution for quick data migration from a relational database into a document-oriented database. We have created semi-automatically two logical levels over physical data. Users can refine generated logical data model and configure data migration template for each needed document. Data migration features are implemented into relational database browser Dig Browser. Real patients' database was migrated to Clasterpoint database. The offered approach provides means to obtain at least proof-of-concept for new document-oriented database solution in a couple of days.},

The paper discusses the significant differences that exist between Web applications and conventional software, the taxonomy of Web applications, the progress made so far and the research issues and experience of creating a specialisation at the master's level. The paper reaches a conclusion that Web Engineering at this stage is a moving target since Web technologies are constantly evolving, making new types of applications possible, which in turn may require innovations in how they are built, deployed and maintained.},

@article{Yli-Huumo2016TD,
abstract = {Technical debt (TD) is a metaphor for taking shortcuts or workarounds in technical decisions to gain short-term benefit in time-to-market and earlier software release. In this study, one large software development organization is investigated to gather empirical evidence related to the concept of technical debt management (TDM). We used the exploratory case study method to collect and analyze empirical data in the case organization by interviewing a total of 25 persons in eight software development teams. We were able to identify teams where the current strategy for TDM was only to fix TD when necessary, when it started to cause too much trouble for development. We also identified teams where the management had a systematic strategy to identify, measure and monitor TD during the development process. It seems that TDM can be associated with a similar maturity concept as software development in general. Development teams may raise their maturity by increasing their awareness and applying more advanced processes, techniques and tools in TDM. TDM is an essential part of sustainable software development, and companies have to find right approaches to deal with TD to produce healthy software that can be developed and maintained in the future.},

In the context of an Italian Research Project devoted to the empirical assessment of migration techniques and tools, this paper reports on a survey, performed among 59 Italian Information Technology (IT) companies, with the aim of investigating about their experiences in software migration, their main migration goals, and the pieces of technology adopted. The research project and the survey focused, in particular on in-house migration projects towards the Web, service oriented architectures and wireless environments. A preliminary analysis of results confirmed that software migration is a very relevant phenomenon. Most migration activities performed in recent years targeted the Web, with a few number of migrations towards mobile and towards service-oriented architectures. Among other things, the survey highlights a limited, and insufficient, usage and availability of tools for supporting migration tasks.},

Migrating from SQL database to NoSQL and providing efficient query become growing imperative. However, join operation is not supported in NoSQL database and read separately for multiple times which brings poor performance is unavoidable. This paper proposes a schema conversion model for transforming SQL database to NoSQL which can provide high performance of join query with nesting relevant tables, and a graph transforming algorithm for containing all required content of join query in a table by offering correctly nested sequence. A rigorous proof about the transform algorithm has been conducted and the experiment has verified the correctness of the conversion model and the high performance of join operation.},

The incremental approach and resulting parallel operations of both systems are the most significant technical drivers for complexity in this environment. Furthermore, this report describes the process for planning, analyzing and designing a replacement system that is backed by strong user acceptance. The user interface design task of taking the system from VT100 to a web interface was a critical success factor, as well as live testing with actual production data and actual user interactions. Other aspects such as training and end user documentation are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Oasis2006SOA,
abstract = {This Reference Model for Service Oriented Architecture is an abstract framework for understanding significant entities and relationships between them within a service-oriented environment, and for the development of consistent standards or specifications supporting that environment. It is based on unifying concepts of SOA and may be used by architects developing specific service oriented architectures or in training and explaining SOA. A reference model is not directly tied to any standards, technologies or other concrete implementation details. It does seek to provide a common semantics that can be used unambiguously across and between different implementations. The relationship between the Reference Model and particular architectures, technologies and other aspects of SOA is illustrated in Figure 1. While service-orientation may be a popular concept found in a broad variety of applications, this reference model focuses on the field of software architecture. The concepts and relationships described may apply to other "service" environments; however, this specification makes no attempt to completely account for use outside of the software domain.},

abstract = {Today, reliable software systems are the basis of any business or company. The continuous further development of those systems is the central component in software evolution. It requires a huge amount of time-, man power- as well as financial resources. The challenges are size, seniority and heterogeneity of those software systems. Christian Wagner addresses software evolution: the inherent problems and uncertainties in the process. He presents a model-driven method which leads to a synchronization between source code and design. As a result the model layer will be the central part in further evolution and source code becomes a by-product. For the first time a model-driven procedure for maintenance and migration of software systems is described. The procedure is composed of a model-driven reengineering and a model-driven migration phase. The application and effectiveness of the procedure are confirmed with a reference implementation applied to four exemplary systems.},

@article{Rocha2015RelationalNoSQL,
abstract = {In software development, migration from a Data Base Management System (DBMS) to another, especially with distinct characteristics, is a challenge for programmers and database administrators. Changes in the application code in order to comply with new DBMS are usually vast, causing migrations infeasible. In order to tackle this problem, we present NoSQLayer, a framework capable to support conveniently migrating from relational (i.e., MySQL) to NoSQL DBMS (i.e., MongoDB). This framework is presented in two parts: (1) migration module; and, (2) mapping module. The first one is a set of methods enabling seamless migration between DBMSs (i.e. MySQL to MongoDB). The latter provides a persistence layer to process database requests, being capable to translate and execute these requests in any DBMS, returning the data in a suitable format as well. Experiments show NoSQLayer as a handful solution suitable to handle large volume of data (e.g., Web scale) in which traditional relational DBMS might be inept in the duty.},

We document and evaluate four case studies by considering various factors that the respective companies need to consider in a cloud migration process. We look at migration project as a software re-engineering activity, involving project planning, cloud architecture design and architecture transformation. Specifically for software vendors, a cloud migration opens opportunities such as the possibility of modernising their software through re-engineering their product architecture. However, small and mid-size enterprises(SMEs)often do not have the required cloud expertise to plan and implement a cloud migration.},

@article{Gitzel2007WebEngineeringMDD,
abstract = {A lot of research is currently conducted in the field of Model-Driven Development (MDD), especially regarding its applications to specific domains. Another field that enjoys a great amount of popularity is the Web. As a result, one of the domains MDD is applied to quite frequently is that of Web Applications. However, Web Engineering differs significantly from general Software Engineering and a number of well-established non-MDD solutions already exist in that field. This leads to several interesting questions, which have been left unanswered so far. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing whether the problems encountered in the field of Web Engineering can really be solved with MDD approaches. We also answer the questions whether MDD will be able to solve these problems better and/or cheaper than traditional Web Engineering approaches and whether the current Web MDD propositions live up to this potential. While answering these questions, we will show that there exists a great synergy between the two groups and that the success of MDD in the Web domain will depend on exploiting the strengths of both. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The framework presented in this paper allows the programmer to expose arbitrary desktop applications as web applications without requiring any changes in the source code of that application. Dialogs are rendered using HTML and JavaScript and a flexible event model transparently forwards user interaction at a web browser to the application running at the backend. By employing a cross-language compiler it is also possible to transparently execute parts of the application on the client side inside the web browser.},
