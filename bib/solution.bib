abstract = {This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer project carried out in coopera- tion between the University of Salerno and a small software company. The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrial partner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacy systems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of the partner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decompos- ability with spaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the user interface descriptions. For this reason, it was decided to adopt an incremental migration strategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology, on the transformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs, and the wrapping of the legacy programs. A middleware framework links the new Web-based user interface with the Wrapped Legacy System. An Eclipse plug-in, named MELIS (migration environment for legacy information systems), was also developed to support the migration process. Both the migration strategy and the tool have been applied to two essential subsystems of the most business critical legacy system of the partner company.

abstract = {Today, reliable software systems are the basis of any business or company. The continuous further development of those systems is the central component in software evolution. It requires a huge amount of time-, man power- as well as financial resources. The challenges are size, seniority and heterogeneity of those software systems. Christian Wagner addresses software evolution: the inherent problems and uncertainties in the process. He presents a model-driven method which leads to a synchronization between source code and design. As a result the model layer will be the central part in further evolution and source code becomes a by-product. For the first time a model-driven procedure for maintenance and migration of software systems is described. The procedure is composed of a model-driven reengineering and a model-driven migration phase. The application and effectiveness of the procedure are confirmed with a reference implementation applied to four exemplary systems.},

abstract = {Injuries and infectious respiratory, gastrointestinal end dermatologic diseases are common in day care settings. Most day care injuries are contusions, abrasions and cuts involving the head and extremities. Impact- absorbing surfaces under playground equipment, safety-proofing of all play areas, increased staff supervision, and staff and parental education might reduce injuries by as much as 75 percent. Respiratory illnesses are the most common day care infections. Chemoprophylaxis with rifampin is required for all close contacts of children infected with Haemophilus influenzae type B and Neisseria meningitidis. Diarrheal illness may be caused by viral pathogens, bacterial agents such as Shigella, Campylobacter or Salmonella, or parasitic infections caused by Glardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium. Strict hand-washing procedures, especially before food preparation end after toileting, may reduce diarrheal illness by 50 percent. Head lice (Pediculosis capitis) and scabies are common dermatologic infections spread by direct contact and through clothing, bedding and hair brushes. Screening and treating affected children with permethrin preparations and thoroughly washing bedding and clothing are necessary to stop outbreaks. Use of universal precautions for the handling of stool is essential to prevent the spread of both ordinary diarrheal illnesses and serious infections such as hepatitis A and B, human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus.},

@article{Tunkelang2009FacetedSearch,
abstract = {We live in an information age that requires us, more than ever, to represent, access, and use information. Over the last several decades, we have developed a modern science and technology for information retrieval, relentlessly pursuing the vision of a "memex" that Vannevar Bush proposed in his seminal article, "As We May Think." Faceted search plays a key role in this program. Faceted search addresses weaknesses of conventional search approaches and has emerged as a foundation for interactive information retrieval. User studies demonstrate that faceted search provides more effective information-seeking support to users than best-first search. Indeed, faceted search has become increasingly prevalent in online information access systems, particularly for e-commerce and site search. In this lecture, we explore the history, theory, and practice of faceted search. Although we cannot hope to be exhaustive, our aim is to provide sufficient depth and breadth to offer a useful resource to both researchers and practitioners. Because faceted search is an area of interest to computer scientists, information scientists, interface designers, and usability researchers, we do not assume that the reader is a specialist in any of these fields. Rather, we offer a self-contained treatment of the topic, with an extensive bibliography for those who would like to pursue particular aspects in more depth. Table of Contents: I.

Therefore, we outline a rapid prototyping approach for Web Migration, assess technologies which allow execution of legacy code in the browser and present a solution architecture, process and supporting infrastructure based on WebAssembly.

abstract = {A new web content structure analysis based on visual representation is proposed in this paper. Many web applications such as information retrieval, information extraction and automatic page adaptation can benefit from this structure. This paper presents an automatic top-down, tag-tree independent approach to detect web content structure. It simulates how a user understands web layout structure based on his visual perception. Comparing to other existing techniques, our approach is independent to underlying documentation representation such as HTML and works well even when the HTML structure is far different from layout structure. Experiments show satisfactory results.},

To illustrate Crowdsourced Reverse Engineering, we outline our approach for performing the Reverse Engineering activity of concept assignment as a crowdsourced classification task and address suitable methods and considerations with regard to each of the the three challenges. Following a brief overview on existing research in which we position our approach against related work, we report on our experiences from an experiment conducted on the crowdsourcing platform microworkers.com, which yielded 187 results by 34 crowd workers, classifying 10 code fragments with decent quality.},

However, a migration process entails costs and risks that depend on the characteristics of both the architecture of the source system and the target client-server platform. We propose an approach to program decomposition as a preliminary step for the migration of legacy systems. A program slicing algorithm is defined to identify the statements implementing the user interface component. An interactive re-engineering tool is also presented that supports the software engineer in the comprehension of the source code during the decomposition of a program. The focus of this paper is on the partition of a legacy system, while issues related to the re-engineering, encapsulation, and wrapping of the legacy components and to the definition of the middleware layer through which they communicate are not tackled.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Ensuring similarity of user interfaces (UI) is often desirable, e.g. in software migration and redesign projects, to minimize experience disruption for regular users and increase subjective satisfaction with new versions. In our paper we explore applicability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to support test-driven development by predicting similarity assessments without employing the actual users. Having reviewed requirements engineering (RE) standards and practices for HCI-related requirements, we identified two dimensions for similarity of web UIs: 1) objective, the data for which we collected with a dedicated web intelligence miner and 2) user-subjective, operationalized with the renowned Kansei Engineering method. Then we constructed the respective ANN models predicting perceived similarity between websites of a same domain and trained the models with the data we collected in experimental sessions with 209 participants of different nationalities and 21 operational university websites. The results of our pilot study suggest that subjective "emotional" factors are considerably more important in predicting similarity evaluations provided by users. Thus, employment of trained ANNs as test oracles may be feasible in automated measurement and control of UI similarity.},
