NAME and REF, PROJECT, OVERALL AIM, MAIN FOCUS, METHOD, EVIDENCE & LEGACY 

XIRUP (eXtreme end-User dRiven Process) is the modernization process developed in the MOMOCS (MOdel driven MOdernisation of Complex Systems) EU FP6-IST STREP research project^[http://www.momocs.org/ accesible through Wayback Machine snapshot form June 24, 2013: https://web.archive.org/web/20130511080350/http://www.momocs.org:80/, see also https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/79455_en.html]. 

MOMOCS aims at studying a methodology and related tools for fast reengineering of complex systems. A complex system is characterised by an interconnection of hardware, software, user interfaces, firmware, business and production processes. MOMOCS will study how a complex system can be modernised with a focus on the software portion of it, with the goal of keeping up with a very fast changing business and technical environment taking human beings as the centre of the interaction. MOMOCS will thus allow the end-user to concentrate on what to do and not how to do it. MOMOCS methodology aims at solving the dilemma between rigorous and bureaucratic methodologies and agile and unstructured ones by building an eXtreme end-User dRiven Process, which will be named XIRUP, and related supporting tools. MOMOCS modernisation methodology will apply to complex systems and will reengineer software architectures, data heterogeneities and processes in order to make systems behaviour more predictable in terms of performance, stability and upgradeability. MOMOCS methodology will also address the heterogeneity of user interfaces and implementations by making user interfaces easier to understand resulting in fewer man-machine interaction errors and by making the maintenance skill pool smaller. MOMOCS methodology and tools will be studied in a way that is independent of the specific platform in which the final complex system will be instantiated. MOMOCS will also develop the models and software tools to support the methodology. MOMOCS methodology will leverage on standards made by OMG such as MOF, XMI and UML, and will deliver a meta-model described as a MOF model which will be characterised by an easy learning curve and de-bureaucratise MDA, thus enabling the fast reengineering of complex systems.

XIRUP methodology [7] was proposed in MOMOCS
Project. XIRUP is considered as a general-purpose MDE-based
modernization methodology, not specifically designed to
address the challenges of migrating legacy applications to
cloud environments. In particular, XIRUP is a feature-driven
modernization methodology, where the whole legacy system is
decomposed into features (as offered by encapsulated components) that are iteratively evaluated (for migration
decision support), migrated and assessed (post-migration
evaluation). This approach could fit well when a partial
migration is required (e.g. hybrid Cloud environment,
including some migrated components coexisting with some
legacy components). XIRUP also defines method fragments as
well isolated engineering processes for software
modernization, in line with the Situational Methods
Engineering techniques [8] and assigns groups of methods
fragments to concrete XIRUP methodology phases.
Nonetheless, even if some of these methods fragments are
applicable to foreseen ARTIST methodology phases, they need
to be aligned and extended to cope with the particularities of
the migration to the Cloud.





There is also a number of migration methods developed
in various research projects. One of them is the XIRUP process for modernization developed in the MOMOCS project ((MOdel driven MOdernisation of Complex Systems) [10]. The phases of the XIRUP process are preliminary evaluation, understanding, building
and migration. The
method relies on models and transformations but does not include services and SOA.
