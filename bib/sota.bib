abstract = {In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This chapter provides a historic overview, focusing on the methods and techniques used in legacy to SOA evolution. The authors conducted a systematic literature review to collect legacy to SOA evolution approaches reported from 2000 to August 2011. To this end, 121 primary studies were found and evaluated using an evaluation framework, which was developed from three evolution and modernization methods widely used in the software re-engineering domain. The evaluation constitutes the inventory of current research approaches and methods and techniques used in legacy to SOA evolution. The result of the SLR also identifies current research issues in legacy to SOA evolution and provides future research directions to address those research issues.},

abstract = {Legacy systems constitute valuable assets to the organizations that own them, and today, there is an increased demand to make them accessible through the World Wide Web to support e-commerce activities. As a result, the problem of legacy-interface migration is becoming very important. In the context of the CELLEST project, we have developed a new process for migrating legacy user interfaces to web-accessible platforms. Instead of analyzing the application code to extract a model of its structure, the CELLEST process analyzes traces of the system-user interaction to model the behavior of the application's user interface. The produced state-transition model specifies the unique legacy-interface screens (as states) and the possible commands leading from one screen to another (as transitions between the states). The interface screens are identified as clusters of similar-in-appearance snapshots in the recorded trace. Next, the syntax of each transition command is extracted as the pattern shared by all the transition instances found in the trace. This user-interface model is used as the basis for constructing models of the tasks performed by the legacy-application users; these task models are subsequently used to develop new web-accessible interface front ends for executing these tasks. In this paper, we discuss the CELLEST method for reverse engineering a state-transition model of the legacy interface, we illustrate it with examples, we discuss the results of our experimentation with it, and we discuss how this model can be used to support the development of new interface front ends.},

In particular when the legacy system is still applied in the field, the vendor must ensure a seamless change to the modernized system to not lose any economical assets and to keep the business running. As with normal development processes, testing is also inevitable for a modernization process to gain confidence that the modernized system behaves correctly. This paper describes an experience report from the FP 7 research project REMICS that deals with model-driven modernization of legacy systems to the cloud. We employed a model-based testing process for safeguarding the correct migration of the modernized system's functionality. As test modeling language, the UML Testing Profile was applied. The modernized system, called DOME, was one of the case studies contributed by one of the business partners of the project. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

We present a framework, named Legacy-to-Cloud Migration Horseshoe, for supporting the migration of legacy systems to cloud computing. The framework leverages the software reengineering concepts that aim to recover the architecture from legacy source code. Then the framework exploits the software evolution concepts to support architecture-driven migration of legacy systems to cloud-based architectures. The Legacy- to-Cloud Migration Horseshoe comprises of four processes: (i) architecture migration planning, (ii) architecture recovery and consistency, (iii) architecture transformation and (iv) architecture- based development of cloud-enabled software. We aim to discover, document and apply the migration process patterns that enhance the reusability of migration processes. We also discuss the required tool support that we intend to provide through our ongoing work in this area.},

abstract = {Large-scale Web Applications, especially those intended to publish contents and provide information to its users, are by nature subject to continuous and fast changes. This often means fast obsolescence of the design documentation and a lot of effort required to comprehend the application when performing maintenance and evolution tasks. This paper presents a reverse engineering approach for Web Applications enabling the semi-automatic recovery of user-centered conceptual models describing, from a user perspective, key aspects, such as the delivered contents and navigational paths. The abstracted models are formalized according to the Ubiquitous Web Applications (UWA) design methodology, but any other design method for Web Applications could be used instead. The paper describes the recovery process, a tool developed to support the process, and the results from a case study conducted to validate the approach on a set of real world Web Applications.},

In the context of an Italian Research Project devoted to the empirical assessment of migration techniques and tools, this paper reports on a survey, performed among 59 Italian Information Technology (IT) companies, with the aim of investigating about their experiences in software migration, their main migration goals, and the pieces of technology adopted. The research project and the survey focused, in particular on in-house migration projects towards the Web, service oriented architectures and wireless environments. A preliminary analysis of results confirmed that software migration is a very relevant phenomenon. Most migration activities performed in recent years targeted the Web, with a few number of migrations towards mobile and towards service-oriented architectures. Among other things, the survey highlights a limited, and insufficient, usage and availability of tools for supporting migration tasks.},

It requires a huge amount of time-, man power- as well as financial resources. The challenges are size, seniority and heterogeneity of those software systems. Christian Wagner addresses software evolution: the inherent problems and uncertainties in the process. He presents a model-driven method which leads to a synchronization between source code and design. As a result the model layer will be the central part in further evolution and source code becomes a by-product. For the first time a model-driven procedure for maintenance and migration of software systems is described. The procedure is composed of a model-driven reengineering and a model-driven migration phase. The application and effectiveness of the procedure are confirmed with a reference implementation applied to four exemplary systems.},

We report on the usage and structure of the method used to effectively analyze, design, implement, and deploy service-oriented architecture (SOA) projects as part of a fractal model of software development. We also assert that the construct of a service and service modeling, although introduced by SOA, is a software engineering best practice for which an SOA method aids both SOA usage and adoption. In this paper we present the latest updates to this method and share some of the lessons learned. The SOMA method incorporates the key aspects of overall SOA solution design and delivery and is integrated with existing software development methods through a set of placeholders for key activity areas, forming what we call solution templates. We also present a fractal model of software development that can enable the SOMA method to evolve in an approach that goes beyond the iterative and incremental and instead leverages method components and patterns in a recursive, self-similar manner opportunistically at points of variability in the life cycle.

Like today's software developments, migration projects are faced with steadily increasing demands for efficiency: migration has to be carried out faster, better, and cheaper. At the same time, migration complexity increases, and migration projects remain challenging despite the companies' extensive experience. To cope with such efficiency demands, companies need a well-defined migration strategy. In previous work, we have defined such a migration strategy called lean and mean strategy. In this paper, following technical action research, we apply our migration strategy, and evaluate it, in two large industrial case studies in the field of data migration. The use of the strategy in our case studies reveals the benefits of lean and mean strategy for meeting the efficiency demands. Copyright},

However, many such techniques focus solely on green-field development, and do not properly address the situation of leveraging the value locked in legacy systems. The redesign process supported by UWAT+ holistically blends design recovery technologies for capturing the know-how embedded in the legacy application with forward design methods particularly well suited for Web-based systems. The case study highlights some of the benefits of using UWAT+ in this context, as well as identifying possible areas for improvement in the redesign process and opportunities for tool automation to support it.},

There is, however, considerable difference between SOA migration approaches defined in academia and those emerged in industry. This difference pinpoints a potential gap between theory and practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted an industrial interview survey in seven leading SOA solution provider companies. Results have been analyzed with respect to migration activities, the available knowledge assets and the migration process. In addition, industrial approaches have been contrasted with academic ones, hence discussing differences and promising directions for industry-relevant research. As a result we found that, in fact, all companies converge to the same, one, common SOA migration approach. This suggests that, with experience, enterprises mature toward a similar approach to SOA migration.},

Our model-based approach CloudMIG aims at supporting SaaS providers to semi-automatically migrate legacy software systems to the cloud. Thereby, the analysis of conformance with the specific constraints imposed by a cloud environment candidate along with the detection of constraint violations constitutes an important early phase activity. We present an extensible architecture for describing cloud environments, their corresponding constraints, and appropriate violation detection mechanisms. There exist predefined constraint types with specified domain semantics as well as generic variants for modeling arbitrary constraints. A software system's compliance can be examined with the assistance of so called constraint validators. They operate on discovered KDM-based models of a legacy system. Additional constraint validators can be plugged into the validation process as needed. In this context, we implemented a prototype and modeled the PaaS environment Google App Engine for Java. We report on a quantitative evaluation regarding the detected constraint violations of five open source systems.},

@article{McDonald2005AWE,
abstract = {The Agile Web Engineering (AWE) Process was developed during 2001 to address the challenges that we believe new effective Web development processes will have to tackle. In October 2001, Andrew McDonald started a one year Ph.D. Internship with a Fortune 500 Global Financial Services Company with the goal of exploring the use of AWE in a commercial environment. In this paper we discuss the results of two surveys within the company. First, a company sponsored review of the current in-house software development process, before AWE's first commercial pilot. Second, a survey of development and line management staff in both the business and the technology sectors, after AWE's first commercial pilot. The initial survey established how a large company, with extensive experience of software development, was coping with the changing demands of developing Web-based applications and other software projects where time-to-market pressures are a major driver. After introducing the principles of an agile approach to software development we carried out a successful pilot using AWE on a retail Internet banking application, significantly increasing end-user task completion rates. We then carried out a further survey to assess company stakeholders' impressions of AWE. Both the pre- and post-AWE Pilot surveys strongly suggest that the company is trying to cope with Web Engineering process challenges similar to those facing other organisations. The post-AWE pilot survey indicates that the AWE process is better suited and more capable as a Web Engineering process than the current in-house company process. The post-AWE Pilot also describes the primary hurdles encountered to getting AWE officially adopted within the company, these include: need for a cultural change before agile processes, including AWE, could be successfully adopted; inertia and the company's desire to have a one-size fits all process approach as opposed to processes specific to different categories of software development. We validated our findings using Boehm and Turner's 'home grounds' analysis to identify the company's sweet-spot in the process spectrum. Using home grounds analysis we identify that plan-driven processes rather than agile processes are better suited to typical projects within the company. However, home grounds analysis and both our surveys strongly indicate that better results can be achieved in Web Engineering projects within the company, by using an agile process approach, such as AWE, specifically focused on Web-based application development.},

Over a decade there has been an increasing interest in the approaches addressing SOA migration. These approaches mainly differ in ‘what is migrated' and ‘how the migration is performed'. Such differences aggravate achieving a general understanding of ‘what SOA migration entails'. To solve this problem, we conducted a systematic review that extracts main migration categories, called SOA migration families, from the approaches proposed in the research community. Based on the results of the systematic review, we describe eight distinct families along with their characteristics and goals. These families represent a first frame of reference for SOA migration which brings order and enhances understanding on how migration can be carried out.},

abstract = {The number of Web users and the diversity of their interests increase continuously; Web-content providers seek to infer these interests and to adapt their Web sites to improve accessibility of the offered content. Usage-pattern mining is a promising approach in support of this goal. Assuming that past navigation behavior is an indicator of the users' interests, then, Web-server logs can be mined to infer what the users are interested in. On that basis, the Web site may be reorganized to make the interesting content more easily accessible or recommendations can be dynamically generated to help new visitors find information of interest faster. In this paper, we discuss a case study examining the effectiveness of sequential-pattern mining for understanding the users' navigation behavior in focused Web sites. This study examines the Web site of an undergraduate course, as an example of a focused Web site that offers information intrinsically related to a process and closely reflects the workflow of this underlying process. We found that in such focused sites, indeed, visitor behavior reflects the process supported by the Web site and that sequential-pattern mining can effectively predict Web-usage behavior in these sites.

abstract = {Legacy systems are often business critical and are associated with high maintenance costs. In this paper, we present an overview of a method, Renaissance, which aims to manage the process of regaining control over such systems. Renaissance supports system evolution by first recovering a stable basis using reengineering, and subsequently continuously improving the system by a stream of incremental changes. In both cases, the extent of evolution is determined by a phase which takes into account of technical, business, and organisational factors. Renaissance defines a process framework, a predefined number of evolution strategies, an information repository, and a generic set of personnel responsibilities. The method can be tailored to the needs of particular projects and organisations, and it is not prescriptive of particular tools and techniques.},

@article{Frey2011CloudMIG,
abstract = {Cloud computing provides means for reducing over- and under-provisioning through enabling a highly flexible resource allocation. Running an existing software system on a cloud computing basis can involve extensive reengineering activities during the migration. To reduce the correspondent effort, it is often possible to deploy an existing system widely unmodified in IaaS VM instances. However, this simplistic migration approach does not solve the challenge of over- and under-provisioning or scalability issues per se, as our experiments using Eucalyptus and the popular open source system Apache OFBiz show. Moreover, current migration approaches suffer from several further shortcomings. For example, they are often limited to specific cloud environments or do not provide automated support for the alignment with a cloud environment. We present our model-based approach CloudMIG which addresses these shortcomings. It aims at supporting SaaS providers to semi-automatically migrate existing enterprise software systems to scalable and resource-efficient PaaS and IaaS-based applications. To facilitate reasoning about the suitability of certain cloud environments for a given system and the degree of alignment during the reengineering process, we introduce the Cloud Suitability and Alignment (CSA) hierarchy. For example, Apache OFBiz used in our experiments is initially categorized “cloud compatible” but not "cloud optimized" as it does not exploit the cloud's advantages.},

@article{Gold2005ConceptSlicing,
abstract = {Program slicing and concept assignment have both been proposed as source code extraction techniques. Unfortunately, each has a weakness that prevents wider application. For slicing, the extraction criterion is expressed at a very low level; constructing a slicing criterion requires detailed code knowledge which is often unavailable. The concept assignment extraction criterion is expressed at the domain level. However, unlike a slice, the extracted code is not executable as a separate subprogram in its own right. This paper introduces a unification of slicing and concept assignment which exploits their combined advantages, while overcoming these two individual weaknesses. Our ‘concept slices' are executable programs extracted using high-level criteria. The paper introduces four techniques that combine slicing and concept assignment and algorithms for each. These algorithms were implemented in two separate tools used to illustrate the application of the concept slicing algorithms in two very different case studies. The first is a commercially-written COBOL module from a large financial organization, the second is an open source utility program written in C.

However, due to the development of newer and faster hardware platforms and the invention of novel interface styles, there is a great demand for their migration to new platforms. We present a method for reverse engineering the system interface that consists of two tasks. Based on traces of the users interaction with the system, the ldquo;interface mapping rdquo; task constructs a ldquo;map rdquo; of the system interface, in terms of the individual system screens and the transitions between them. The subsequent ldquo;task and domain modeling rdquo; task uses the interface map and task-specific traces to construct an abstract model of a user's task as an information exchange plan. The task model specifies the screen transition diagram that the user has to traverse in order to accomplish the task in question, and the flow of information that the user exchanges with the system at each screen. This task model is later used as the basis for specifying a new graphical user interface tailored to the task in question.},

@article{Perez-Castillo2013PRECISO,
abstract = {In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Web service standards, based on WSDL, have been adopted as a process-to-process communication paradigm. This paper presents an industrial experience in integrating data-intensive and process-intensive Web applications through Web services. Design of sites and of Web services interaction exploits modern Web engineering methods, including conceptual modeling, model verification, visual data marshalling and automatic code generation. In particular, the applied method is based on a declarative model for specifying data-intensive Web applications that enact complex interactions, driven by the user, with remote processes implemented as services. We describe the internal architecture of the CASE tool that has been used, and give an overview of three industrial applications developed with the described approach.},

Model-Driven Modernization combined with Software as a Service delivery model is a very promising approach, which possesses a lot of advantages, including reduced costs, automation of migration activities and reuse of system functionality. However, a drawback of such an innovative modernization approach is that it lacks mature software process models to guide its adoption. Thus, a methodology for seamless execution of different migration and deployment activities is quite needed. On the other hand, agile development methods have been successfully adopted in various projects, which partly or thoroughly use the engineering and delivery models exploited in the modernization process. This paper presents how a particular methodology for Model-Driven Modernization with deployment to the Cloud is enriched with agile techniques to address different challenging issues. The extended agile methodology could be used by organizations which have already applied agile software development as well as by organizations that plan to introduce it in their work. Keywords-},

Most day care injuries are contusions, abrasions and cuts involving the head and extremities.

Respiratory illnesses are the most common day care infections. Chemoprophylaxis with rifampin is required for all close contacts of children infected with Haemophilus influenzae type B and Neisseria meningitidis. Diarrheal illness may be caused by viral pathogens, bacterial agents such as Shigella, Campylobacter or Salmonella, or parasitic infections caused by Glardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium. Strict hand-washing procedures, especially before food preparation end after toileting, may reduce diarrheal illness by 50 percent. Head lice (Pediculosis capitis) and scabies are common dermatologic infections spread by direct contact and through clothing, bedding and hair brushes. Screening and treating affected children with permethrin preparations and thoroughly washing bedding and clothing are necessary to stop outbreaks.

@article{Lucia2008,
abstract = {This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer project carried out in coopera- tion between the University of Salerno and a small software company. The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrial partner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacy systems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of the partner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decompos- ability with spaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the user interface descriptions. For this reason, it was decided to adopt an incremental migration strategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology, on the transformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs, and the wrapping of the legacy programs. A middleware framework links the new Web-based user interface with the Wrapped Legacy System. An Eclipse plug-in, named MELIS (migration environment for legacy information systems), was also developed to support the migration process. Both the migration strategy and the tool have been applied to two essential subsystems of the most business critical legacy system of the partner company.

In order to place current evolution techniques into context, we also provide a survey of the different kinds of web systems as they have emerged, tracing the most important achievements of web systems evolution research from static web sites over dynamic web applications and web services to Ajax-based Rich Internet Applications.},

As there is still little conceptual characterization of what the legacy to SOA migration process entails it is difficult to understand, compare and assess different approaches. This paper therefore proposes a conceptual framework embracing a holistic illustration of such a migration process. We describe what such migration process entails and what distinct conceptual elements systematically define the process. Based on the constituting conceptual elements, the framework which is considered as a basis for understanding and assessment of different approaches is proposed.

The overall static structure of the rational unified process (RUP), originally developed for forward systems engineering, has been here adapted for reengineering and is used for PARFAIT documentation. Frameworks are used in the process aiming at an agile approach to support the reengineering. Frameworks allow applications to be rapidly created, more than if they are built from scratch. Agile characteristics, such as incremental approach, cooperative approach with users and customers, straightforwardness, etc. give PARFAIT the ability to support the rapid evolution of the legacy system to a new version, according to the users and customers needs. A summary of a case study and the results obtained in the reengineering are presented. This study refers to a concrete reengineering case of a real system for controlling entry and exit of electronic appliances in a repair shop.},

Cobol is not a distributed and object-oriented language, however its integration with other languages or distributed systems is a prerequisite for achieving migration towards Web technologies. Moreover, the user interface and user interaction modalities need to be changed. Numerous strategies have been proposed for wrapping the business logic and re-implementing the user interface, but there is still a great need for experimental research. This paper presents a migration strategy whose target system is a Web-enabled architecture based on the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. By extracting all the needed information from the Cobol source code, the realized toolkit can automatically generate wrappers for the business logic and the data model and the Web user interface as Java server pages. The strategy and the toolkit presented have been defined within the project M{\&}S SW, a research project aimed at defining new technological solutions to be transferred to small and medium enterprises operating in information and communication technologies.},

We propose a migration process for desktop applications with a text-based user interface, which mitigates existing security concerns and enables the software to perform safely in the web without modifying its of the source code. Additionally, we describe an open source tool that facilitates our migration process.},

An alternative source of evidence, especially valuable for understanding the purposes for which the application was built, can be the dynamic behavior of the system, and more specifically the system-user interaction. We have developed a method for modeling the application behavior from the user's perspective in the form of use case models, using recorded traces of system-user interaction. We use data mining and pattern matching methods to mine these traces for frequently occurring user tasks. When interesting patterns are discovered, they are augmented with semantic information and they are used to build use case models. We demonstrate a successful application of this method to recover use case models from interaction traces with legacy 3270 systems to serve user interface reengineering activities.},

However, many such techniques focus solely on green-field development, and do not properly address the situation of leveraging the value locked in legacy systems. The redesign process supported by UWAT+ holistically blends design recovery technologies for capturing the know-how embedded in the legacy application with forward design methods particularly well suited for Web-based systems.

@article{SosaSanchez2017MigraSOA,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2003-2012 IEEE. The migration of legacy web applications (LWA) to Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) has become mainstream in the last years due to the architectural flexibility that SOA provides, which allows to easily adapt the existing applications to new requirements. However, these migrations are usually ad-hoc and manually performed leading to tedious and error-prone processes. MigraSOA is an approach to migrate (and modernize) LWA to SOA that makes use of Model-Driven Development techniques to face the complexity of the underlying technologies, web services, business processes definition or executable business processes platforms. In addition to globally introducing MigraSOA, this paper focuses on the alignment of the business processes defined by the company with the underlying web services of the LWA.

abstract = {This white paper discusses various modernization scenarios that can and are being applied to existing computer software systems. The specific focus of this paper is to summarize these scenarios and discuss how each scenario leverages the computing standards being developed by the OMG, Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force. Introduction The Object Management Group (OMG) Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) Task Force (ADMTF) is creating a set of standards to facilitate the interoperability of modernization tools. These interoperability standards are being established in a series of meta-models that facilitate the collection, analysis, refactoring and transformation of existing systems. Under these standards, modernization vendors, each of which may support different aspects of the modernization process, can seamlessly interchange application meta-data across platforms, languages and stages of the modernization process. The ADMTF standards that are either in place or under development are discussed in the ADMTF Roadmap White Paper 1 . In order to provide a context and purpose for creating and deploying each of these ADM standards, the ADMTF determined the need to identify a set of scenarios under which one or some combination of these standards might be applied. The ADMTF Roadmap includes the following standards.},

The goal of this case study is to identify the possible benefits and bottlenecks of adopting SOA, as well as to come up with best practices and research directions based on real-life experience gained in IT industry. The case involves an application portfolio of over 700 systems for a company in the transport sector. First, the case study involves the engineering of a portal application involving the integration of various services via the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Second, the case study is concerned with the setting up of a central coordination point within the organization to deal with SOA-related integration requests and requirements coming from different business units. Finally, the case discusses the actual implementation and integration of a service through the ESB. From this case study, a list of lessons learned and research directions is obtained.},

While moving to a serviceoriented architecture platform can help in handling this increase, at the same time it is important to preserve the investment of many years of tuning and debugging of the legacy assets as much as possible. Several techniques exist for modernizing legacy systems towards service-oriented architecture.

In this kind of application, the user executes sets of activities organized into transactions (also generally called workflows) in order to accomplish one of his/her tasks or fulfill one of his/her goals. The way these transactions are structured, the properties associated with their component activities and the way each activity is implemented by the Web application are a consequence of the transaction design as well as the business rules implied by the business process. The Ubiquitous Web Applications (UWA) design framework explicitly includes a design activity and a related meta-model, called the Transaction Design Model, specifically focused on the conceptual design of Web application transactions (Web Transactions for short).

abstract = {Migration software systems to the cloud causes challenges. This applies especially for companies that do not have sufficient cloud expertise. In many of these companies there is a clear ideas about expected benefits. There is also an awareness of some potential problems. However, this is often not sufficient to assess the risks before starting on a full cloud migration of a legacy system. Technical and conceptual analyses can only help to identify risks in the migration process with from a cost and a quality perspective to a limited extent. So, we investigate here the suitability of feasibility studies with a focus on experimental exploration. These studies would generally only cost 5{\%} of the overall costs of a migration project, but can strongly support a reliable risk assessment. These can determine how much of the expectations and intentions can achieved in a cloud deployment. The cost of the migration, but also the cost of operating an IT system in the cloud can be estimated in the context of quality expectations. Using a feasibility study with an experimental core based on a partial prototype delivers much more reliable figures regarding configurations, quality-of-service and costing than a theoretical analysis could deliver. We will embed our feasibility study approach into a pattern-based migration method. We report on a number of case studies to validate the expected benefits of feasibility-driven migration.},

abstract = {Service-oriented architectures (SOA) offer a suitable solution to manage the continuous changes in companies business processes. SOA facilitates the alignment of business process with underlying system services. There is a high percentage of Legacy Web Applications (LWA) developed by software factories that were implemented by using Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks and without considering SOA in their development process. In this context, many companies are performing a modernization of their systems to be adapted to SOA. However, this migration is usually carried out ad-hoc by means of not reusable and error-prone manual processes. Additionally, these migration processes are often performed at a low abstraction level, close to code, hindering reusability and maintainability of the obtained systems. In this paper a Model-Driven systematic and semi-automatic approach to modernizelegacy web applications to SOA is presented. The approacheases the reutilization of the process at different domains, since the underlying services of the LWA are identified andgenerated from model-driven techniques, but also of the newgenerated system since these new services may be offered asan interoperable service layer. Although the paper completely introduces the approach, it mainly focuses on the semantic process defined to discover services of the LWA that may be later associated (aligned) to the company business processes.},

abstract = {Abstract—Background—By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective—This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method—We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results—The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion—This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems},

abstract = {In the context of the CelLEST project, we have been investigating the problem of reengineering and reusing the services provided by legacy applications, running on mainframe hosts. This work has resulted in a suite of methods, based on understanding and modeling the users' interaction with the legacy-application interface. These methods aim at (a) modeling the behavior of the legacy user interface as a state-transition diagram, (b) recovering specifications for the application's functions by discovering the users' tasks as frequently occurring interaction patterns, and (c) constructing new user-interface front-ends to make the recovered legacy functions accessible through the Web. We describe the overall process for legacy migration to the World Wide Web, using the CelLEST methods, and we illustrate it with an example case study.},

abstract = {Nowadays Cloud Computing is considered as the ideal environment for engineering, hosting and provisioning applications. A continuously increasing set of cloud-based solutions is available to application owners and developers to tailor their applications exploiting the advanced features of this paradigm for elasticity, high availability and performance. Although these offerings provide many benefits to new applications, they also incorporate constrains to the modernization and migration of legacy applications by obliging the use of specific technologies and explicit architectural design approaches. The modernization and adaptation of legacy applications to cloud environments is a great challenge for all involved stakeholders, not only from the technical perspective, but also in business level with the need to adapt the business processes and models of the modernized application that will be offered from now on, as a service. In this paper we present a novel model-driven approach for the migration of legacy applications in modern cloud environments which covers all aspects and phases of the migration process, as well as an integrated framework that supports all migration process.},

@article{Fielding2017REST,
abstract = {Seventeen years after its initial publication at ICSE 2000, the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style continues to hold significance as both a guide for understanding how the World Wide Web is designed to work and an example of how principled design, through the application of architectural styles, can impact the development and understanding of large-scale software architecture. However, REST has also become an industry buzzword: frequently abused to suit a particular argument, confused with the general notion of using HTTP, and denigrated for not being more like a programming methodology or implementation framework. In this paper, we chart the history, evolution, and shortcomings of REST, as well as several related architectural styles that it inspired, from the perspective of a chain of doctoral dissertations produced by the University of California's Institute for Software Research at UC Irvine. These successive theses share a common theme: extending the insights of REST to new domains and, in their own way, exploring the boundary of software engineering as it applies to decentralized software architectures and architectural design. We conclude with discussion of the circumstances, environment, and organizational characteristics that gave rise to this body of work.},

@article{Perez-Castillo2011MARBLE,
abstract = {Context: Legacy information systems age over time. These systems cannot be thrown away because they store a significant amount of valuable business knowledge over time, and they cannot be entirely replaced at an acceptable cost. This circumstance is similar to that of the monuments of ancient civilizations, which have aged but still hold meaningful information about their civilizations. Evolutionary maintenance is the most suitable mechanism to deal with the software ageing problem since it preserves business knowledge. But first, recovering the underlying business knowledge in legacy systems is necessary in order to preserve this vital heritage. Objective: This paper proposes and validates a method for recovering and rebuilding business processes from legacy information systems. This method, which can be considered a business process archeology, makes it possible to preserve the business knowledge in legacy information systems. Method: The business process archeology method is framed in MARBLE, a generic framework based on Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM), which uses the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. The proposed method is validated using a case study that involves a real-life legacy system. The case study is conducted following the case study protocol proposed by Brereton et al. Results: The study reports that the proposed method makes it possible to obtain business process models from legacy systems with adequate levels of accuracy. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated positively. Conclusion: The proposed method semi-automatically rebuilds the hidden business processes embedded in a legacy system. Therefore, the business process archeology method quickly allows business experts to have a meaningful understanding of the organization's business processes. This proposal is less time-consuming and more exhaustive (since it considers the embedded business knowledge) than a manual process redesign by experts from scratch. In addition, it helps maintainers to extract the business knowledge needed for the system to evolve. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
