abstract = {This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer project carried out in coopera- tion between the University of Salerno and a small software company. The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrial partner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacy systems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of the partner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decompos- ability with spaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the user interface descriptions. For this reason, it was decided to adopt an incremental migration strategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology, on the transformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs, and the wrapping of the legacy programs. A middleware framework links the new Web-based user interface with the Wrapped Legacy System. An Eclipse plug-in, named MELIS (migration environment for legacy information systems), was also developed to support the migration process. Both the migration strategy and the tool have been applied to two essential subsystems of the most business critical legacy system of the partner company.

In the context of an Italian Research Project devoted to the empirical assessment of migration techniques and tools, this paper reports on a survey, performed among 59 Italian Information Technology (IT) companies, with the aim of investigating about their experiences in software migration, their main migration goals, and the pieces of technology adopted. The research project and the survey focused, in particular on in-house migration projects towards the Web, service oriented architectures and wireless environments. A preliminary analysis of results confirmed that software migration is a very relevant phenomenon. Most migration activities performed in recent years targeted the Web, with a few number of migrations towards mobile and towards service-oriented architectures. Among other things, the survey highlights a limited, and insufficient, usage and availability of tools for supporting migration tasks.},

abstract = {Today, reliable software systems are the basis of any business or company. The continuous further development of those systems is the central component in software evolution. It requires a huge amount of time-, man power- as well as financial resources. The challenges are size, seniority and heterogeneity of those software systems. Christian Wagner addresses software evolution: the inherent problems and uncertainties in the process. He presents a model-driven method which leads to a synchronization between source code and design. As a result the model layer will be the central part in further evolution and source code becomes a by-product. For the first time a model-driven procedure for maintenance and migration of software systems is described. The procedure is composed of a model-driven reengineering and a model-driven migration phase. The application and effectiveness of the procedure are confirmed with a reference implementation applied to four exemplary systems.},

Specifically for software vendors, a cloud migration opens opportunities such as the possibility of modernising their software through re-engineering their product architecture. However, small and mid-size enterprises(SMEs)often do not have the required cloud expertise to plan and implement a cloud migration.},

@article{Gitzel2007WebEngineeringMDD,
abstract = {A lot of research is currently conducted in the field of Model-Driven Development (MDD), especially regarding its applications to specific domains. Another field that enjoys a great amount of popularity is the Web. As a result, one of the domains MDD is applied to quite frequently is that of Web Applications. However, Web Engineering differs significantly from general Software Engineering and a number of well-established non-MDD solutions already exist in that field. This leads to several interesting questions, which have been left unanswered so far. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing whether the problems encountered in the field of Web Engineering can really be solved with MDD approaches. We also answer the questions whether MDD will be able to solve these problems better and/or cheaper than traditional Web Engineering approaches and whether the current Web MDD propositions live up to this potential. While answering these questions, we will show that there exists a great synergy between the two groups and that the success of MDD in the Web domain will depend on exploiting the strengths of both. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of Fintech using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peer-reviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities. The implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed.},

Like today's software developments, migration projects are faced with steadily increasing demands for efficiency: migration has to be carried out faster, better, and cheaper. At the same time, migration complexity increases, and migration projects remain challenging despite the companies' extensive experience. To cope with such efficiency demands, companies need a well-defined migration strategy. In previous work, we have defined such a migration strategy called lean and mean strategy. In this paper, following technical action research, we apply our migration strategy, and evaluate it, in two large industrial case studies in the field of data migration.

The first controlled experiment was conducted within an academic research laboratory with master students in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, while a replicated experiment was conducted in the laboratory of our partner company with both professional programmers and academic researchers. The results revealed that the use of MELIS decrease the time to migrate legacy systems to the web with respect to the use of traditional development tools. Also, less expert software engineers benefit more of the use of MELIS.},

@inproceedings{Almonaies2010SOAStrategies,
abstract = {Although Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become popular in recent years, the majority of legacy systems are still not SOA enabled. The increase in the amount of information that companies must handle has resulted in a considerable increase in the complexity of the legacy systems that store this information. While moving to a serviceoriented architecture platform can help in handling this increase, at the same time it is important to preserve the investment of many years of tuning and debugging of the legacy assets as much as possible. Several techniques exist for modernizing legacy systems towards service-oriented architecture. In this paper we present a survey of the various approaches to moving legacy systems to the SOA environment. We discuss the various approaches and methods and highlight their strengths and weaknesses, with an eye to assisting the decision process when undertaking a new modernization project.},

@inproceedings{Krasteva2013REMICSAgile,
abstract = {Migration of legacy systems to more advanced technologies and platforms is a current issue for many software organizations. Model-Driven Modernization combined with Software as a Service delivery model is a very promising approach, which possesses a lot of advantages, including reduced costs, automation of migration activities and reuse of system functionality. However, a drawback of such an innovative modernization approach is that it lacks mature software process models to guide its adoption. Thus, a methodology for seamless execution of different migration and deployment activities is quite needed. On the other hand, agile development methods have been successfully adopted in various projects, which partly or thoroughly use the engineering and delivery models exploited in the modernization process. This paper presents how a particular methodology for Model-Driven Modernization with deployment to the Cloud is enriched with agile techniques to address different challenging issues. The extended agile methodology could be used by organizations which have already applied agile software development as well as by organizations that plan to introduce it in their work. Keywords-},

@inproceedings{Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization,
abstract = {Existing research in legacy system modernization has traditionally focused on technical challenges, and takes the standpoint that legacy systems are obsolete, yet crucial for an organization's operation. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether practitioners in the industry also share this perception. This paper describes the outcome of an exploratory study in which 26 industrial practitioners were interviewed on what makes a software system a legacy system, what the main drivers are that lead to the modernization of such systems, and what challenges are faced during the modernization process. The findings of the interviews have been validated by means of a survey with 198 respondents. The results show that practitioners value their legacy systems highly, the challenges they face are not just technical, but also include business and organizational aspects.},
