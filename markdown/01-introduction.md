# Introduction

The topic of this thesis is the application of scientific approaches to lower the initial hurdle for small and medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to move from their existing non-web desktop legacy systems to modern web-based systems. The introduction motivates the need for a dedicated approach to address the initial unwillingness and resistance of these companies to commence a Web Migration. High effort and risk due to the lack of a dedicated approach supporting the initial phase of a Web Migration are identified as main challenges. This thesis contributes to the solution of these problems by providing a set of methods and technical infrastructure to support initiation of Web Migration.

## Situation {#sec:situation}

Web-based Systems (web systems) are widely used and familiar for users, as they offer significant advantages over traditional desktop applications such as instant deployment, a common standards-based target development platform and a high level of interactivity.
*Web Migration* is a particular type of *software migration* - the process of moving an existing software system from one environment to another [@SWEBOK2014] - moving a *non-web source system* to a *web-based target environment*. In terms of the joint ISO/IEC and IEEE 14764 standard for software maintenance [@ISO/IEEE2006SoftwareLifeCycle], it is *adaptive and perfective maintenance* adapting software systems for web-based environments and improving functionality and maintainability.
Several related concepts exist in the context of *web-based environments*: web sites, web applications, web services.
Since Web Migration research addresses different types of web-based systems as migration targets, in this thesis, we use the term *web system* as umbrella term following [@Kienle2014EvolutionWeb] and adapting definitions from [@Gaedke2000Diss;@Kappel2006WebEngineering]

**Definition Web System** {#def:websystem}

> A Web System is a software system based on technologies and standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provides Web specific resources.

In contrast to this broad definition, we will use the term *Web Application* for the specific type of web system which is the main focus of this thesis as web migration target, as defined in [@Kappel2006WebEngineering]: 

**Definition Web Application [@Kappel2006WebEngineering]** {#def:webapplication}

>  A Web Application is a software system based on technologies and standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provides Web specific resources such as content and services through a user interface, the Web browser.

One of the main characteristics of *Web Engineering* - the application of systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approaches to development, operation, and maintenance of Web-based applications [@Deshpande2002WebEngineering] - is the continuous evolution of Web technologies [@Gitzel2007WebEngineeringMDD].
Modern web applications are the result of this evolution [@Kienle2014EvolutionWeb] which started with the proposal of Hypertext as Information Management system by Tim Berners Lee in March 1989 [@Berners-Lee1989].
Quickly evolving from the original textual content-focused system, the Web started to be perceived as "a universal, standards-based integration platform" [@Knorr2003WebAsPlatform].
Technologies for dynamic behavior on the client and server side led to the introduction of the term *web application*, formerly also called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), indicating that their user experience became similar to that of *desktop applications* [@Kienle2014EvolutionWeb] (cf. also to RIA features defined in [@Rodriguez-Echeverria2012MIGRARIA]).
Increased usage of dynamic content allowed users to use the Web as mass collaboration system in the era referred to as Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s [@OReilly2005Web2.0].

Driven by a business perspective with a focus on envisioned cost savings and increased flexibility [@Kienle2014EvolutionWeb], composing applications from *Web Services*, i.e., reusable pieces of functionality invokable via HTTP, became a focus in both research and industry.
The architectural paradigm of Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) [@Oasis2006SOA] is closely related to this development and an ecosystem of web protocols such as Web Service Description Language (WSDL) for describing the service interface [@W3C2007WSDL2.0], SOAP as messaging protocol [@W3C2003SOAP] and BPEL for orchestrating web services [@OASIS2007BPEL] was created.

The success of the Web Service paradigm was continued in the advance of *Cloud Computing*, allowing web systems to be built based on scaleable sets of rapidly provisioned, shared resources [@NIST2011CloudComputing].
While the related service models of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) mainly influenced the architecture of web applications, the *Software as a Service (SaaS)* paradigm - the largest segment of the public cloud market with increasing tendency according to [@Statista2018SaaSStatistics] - also impacted end users' perception and expectations of software [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace;@Fowley2017CloudSME] allowing ubiquitous access without installation.

In a similar way, the high popularity and use of mobile devices [@Statista2018MobileWeb] in private and work contexts has changed end users' expectations with regard to high levels of interactivity and social interactions [@Bitkom2013Arbeit30].
This influenced web applications in two ways: the need for open application programming interfaces (APIs) for integration with third-party systems and along with it the creation of corresponding protocols like OAuth [@Hardt2012Oauth2.0] and the requirement of flexible presentation layers capable of handling the vast amount of different screen sizes, resolutions and touch-based interactions giving rise to responsive design frameworks like Bootstrap^[https://getbootstrap.com/].

The above evolution of web systems has brought various advantages over traditional desktop applications, such as:

- Standardized target development platform 
- Instant Deployment 
- Low access requirements
- High level of Interactivity and Social Interactions

In contrast to the wide range of proprietary technologies and frameworks for traditional desktop applications, web applications enable companies to focus on one single target development platform based on *open standards*.
This significantly reduces the development workload that is required to provide software for many different platforms on many different devices, since only one version of the software based on one set of technologies is needed.
Additional effort and cost reductions are achieved by only requiring one development infrastructure and set of tools, as opposed to the platform-wise toolchains (e.g., compilers, IDEs) of desktop applications.
*Open web standards* like HTTP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript form the core of web applications.
They are standardized, published and continuously updated by international standardization bodies like IEEE and W3C and can be publicly accessed and used without restrictions.
Therefore, the risk of technology deprecation is significantly lower than for proprietary desktop application technologies. Development staff needs only be trained on one technological base and can be hired from a potentially more extensive group of developers with experience in web technologies^[cf. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019].

The web's underlying client-server architecture allows for *instant deployment* by enabling to perform updates in one place [@Gitzel2007WebEngineeringMDD].
This is either directly on the server, if the locus of code execution is on the server side, or indirectly on the server if the locus of code execution is on the client side, but the code is distributed via the server.
The ability to instantly deploy new versions is of great advantage for companies since it allows for shorter development cycles and thus faster reactions on changing or new requirements and reduced time-to-market [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization;@Fowley2017CloudSME].

From the end users' perspective, web applications impose *low requirements for accessing software* compared to desktop applications. According to [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace], 86% of end users find SaaS applications help them succeed more than desktop alternatives. They can be used from any system with a web browser. No installation is required, reducing time and complexity for users. The browser has become a *standard interface* [@Aversano2001] / *standard client* [@Gitzel2007WebEngineeringMDD] for many users to access software. Web browsers are available for almost any device and platform used by end users. The resulting high *application portability* [@Gitzel2007WebEngineeringMDD] fosters a ubiquity of software that allows for new work patterns like home office [@Bitkom2013Arbeit30] (cf. *SaaS-Powered Workplace*, 38% of companies almost entirely running on SaaS as of 2017 according to [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace]). The lower complexity and effort gives software companies the chance to address potentially larger users bases [@ForresterResearch2011Modernization].

In particular, *social interactions* in potentially large user bases have become widespread in web applications for end users, allowing the formation of instant online communities [@Bressler2000OnlineCommunities] which that are in turn advantageous for companies through higher levels of user engagement. Also in working contexts, social information sharing is advantageous (cf. *Shareconomy* [@Bitkom2013Arbeit30]).

On the technological level, this is enabled by two main factors. The use of URLs as uniform handles for addressing web resources and application states enables quick sharing of arbitrary web application contents and has seen deep integration into modern platforms, e.g., sharing functionalities of mobile operating systems, and applications, e.g., link-based sharing in most SaaS applications such as Dropbox, Office365 or GitHub. The availability of APIs for third-party developers and corresponding web protocols like OAuth allow better integration with other web applications. 

Due to these advantages, web applications are becoming dominant over desktop applications, with new applications being built as web applications [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace] and existing applications being replaced by web applications [@Gartner2012SaaSSurvey]. A survey of 50 Italian companies identified the web as the main target of migration activities [@Torchiano2008ItalianSurvey]. From a business perspective, the aforementioned cloud computing paradigm of SaaS has seen the most interest [@Statista2018SaaSStatistics]. While SaaS comprises more aspects than software architecture and is thus not a synonym for web applications, the shift from traditional on-premise software to SaaS-based cloud software is closely related to web applications since the required interfaces and communication are mostly implemented using standard web protocols, and most SaaS solutions are accessed via HTTP and use browsers as clients. Thus, the subsequent SaaS-related studies are also indicative of tendencies of usage of traditional on-premise desktop applications in comparison to web applications. 

The total size of the public cloud SaaS market was already 91.75 billion USD worldwide in 2016 [@Statista2018SaaSMarketSize] and is growing [@Statista2018SaaSMarketSize;@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace;@Chan2018SaaSStatistics]
The cloud shift rate of the SaaS market in 2016 to 2020 is growing three times faster than PaaS and two times faster than IaaS [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace]. The number of SaaS applications that organizations use is rising, and many companies will be running purely on SaaS soon [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace]. Software vendors react to these developments by no longer building traditional on-premise software. The vast majority of end users consider SaaS applications more helpful than desktop alternatives [@BetterCloud2017SaaSWorkplace]. Existing solutions are becoming not only extended by but increasingly replaced with SaaS solutions [@Gartner2012SaaSSurvey]. Shifting perspective away from the above business perspective towards evidence from end users, studies show that acceptance of web applications is high even in traditional sectors like banking. For instance, online banking is well-established for internet users in Germany [@BitkomResearch2016DigitalBanking].

## Motivation

Despite the widespread use and familiarity of web applications for end users and their advantages over traditional desktop applications as described above, there are still many *non-web legacy systems* and modernization remains an essential topic in the industry [@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization;@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization;@Gartner2013CIOAgenda;@Gartner2013Priorities;@NASCIO2016;@ForresterResearch2011Modernization].

*Legacy systems* and legacy modernization have been an interest for research for a long time. Several definitions exist in literature. An overview can be found in [@Wagner2014Fundamentals]. In this thesis, we follow the original definition of Brodie and Stonebaker [@Brodie1995Migrating]:

**Definition Legacy System [@Brodie1995Migrating]**

> Any systems that cannot be modified to adapt to continually changing business requirements and their failure can have a severe impact on business.

These legacy systems are characterized as follows: Legacy systems are *business critical*, i.e., they represent great value for the company due to the vast amount of *knowledge* about business processes, rules, etc. [@Aversano2001;@Sneed2010SoftwareMigration;@Wagner2014Fundamentals] resulting from high investments [@Lucia2009METAMORPHOS] and generate a lot of revenue (considered as "cash cows" [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization]). This value can only be preserved through migration into new technological environments [@Fuhr2013SOAMIG]. Legacy systems *resist modification* and evaluation [@Bisbal1999LegacyInformationSystems]. Legacy systems are *poorly documented* or have a complete lack of documentation [@Sneed2010SoftwareMigration;@warren2012renaissance;@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization;@Lucia2008]. There is a *lack of experienced workforce* in the company which developed the system [@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization] due to changes or retirement of the original staff [@Lucia2008]. Legacy systems are *based on obsolete technologies* that are incompatible with current/future technological environments and potentially discontinued [@Perez-Castillo2013PRECISO;@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization;@Heil2016AWSM]. Legacy systems are *too rigid to comply with new business requirements* [@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization].

While the above characteristics cause high effort for maintenance and implementation of new requirements, many legacy systems still exist in the industry [@Fuhr2013SOAMIG]. The main reason for their existence is their business-critical role for the company. Surveys [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization;@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization] show that they are perceived as stable, reliable, proven technology and performance-optimized. Respondents answers indicate a tendency towards the "never touch a running system" mindset [@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization].

Legacy modernization is continuously among the top ten technology priorities for CIOs [@Gartner2013CIOAgenda], at position 5 in both industry [@Gartner2013Priorities] and public sector [@NASCIO2016], with the adoption of cloud computing ranked third [@Gartner2013Priorities;@NASCIO2016] and mobile second [@Gartner2013Priorities], with high expectations [@ForresterResearch2011Modernization].

Closely related to the topic of legacy systems, *technical debt* attracts increasing attention in academia and industry [@Li2015TDSMS;@Yli-Huumo2016TD]. Initially coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992 [@Cunningham1992TD], the technical debt metaphor describes the negative impacts of legacy system characteristics in the long term in analogy to financial debts. A recent definition agreed upon by researchers and practitioners in the 2016 Dagstuhl Seminar "Managing Technical Debt in Software Engineering" is:

**Definition Technical Debt [@Avgeriou2016TD]**

> Technical debt is a collection of design or implementation constructs that are expedient in the short term but set up a technical context that can make future changes more costly or impossible.

Studies over large repositories of software from different domains determine the average Technical Debt per line of code at 3.61 USD, meaning that larger systems with more than 300KLOC accrue more than 1 million USD of Technical Debt. [@CAST2011] Less conservative estimates on the same repository reach more than 15 USD per line of code [@Curtis2012EstimatingTD]. Technical Debt results from intentional and unintentional *violations* of good architectural and coding practices which are likely to cause operational problems like outages, security breaches or which contribute to high costs of ownership, e.g. when implementing changes [@Curtis2012EstimatingTD]. It has two components, the cost of fixing these violations - called *principal* - and the continuing costs of leaving violations unfixed - called *interest*.
In legacy systems, the old technology still in use can be seen as Technical Debt [@Yli-Huumo2016TD].
While technical debt is not the focus of this thesis, the metaphor characterizes legacy systems and helps to understand better the motivation to modernize legacy software.

## Problem statement {#sec:problem}

Making a transition from non-web legacy systems to web-based systems is desirable for companies due to the advantages of the web platform and shortcomings of existing systems detailed above. What is more, this is "widely recognized as a must for keeping competitive in the dynamic business world" [@Aversano2001] to be able to keep pace with changing user expectations and be able to implement new requirements[@Fuhr2013SOAMIG;@Lucia2008].

Commencing a web migration is hard, however. The above reports on software modernization indicate that companies are still struggling to modernize their legacy systems and there are still many non-web legacy systems in existence. Both the business and technical perspective make modernization difficult [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization]. *Effort* and *risk* [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization;@Canfora2000Decomposing;@Bisbal1999LegacyInformationSystems;@Heil2018ReWaMP] are rendering companies hesitant to commence a web migration.

*Effort* [@ISO/IEEE24765Vocabulary] for modernization comprises not only direct development activities, but also managing the modernization project and training users on the new systems [@ISO/IEEE2006SoftwareLifeCycle;@Sneed2010SoftwareMigration;@Seacord2003ModernizingLS].
Even case studies conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed modernization approaches required one person-year or longer. For instance, [@Distante2006] reports 12+ PM for one project (112 KLOC, medium-sized, Visual Basic), [@Bernhart2012] 18+ PM (250 KLOC COBOL), [@Aversano2001] 8PM (130 KLOC COBOL) and [@Maenhaut2015] reports about 14 PM
for two projects. Modernization effort is influenced by the complexity of the legacy architecture [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization] and the decomposability [@Aversano2001;@Lucia2006;@Brodie1995Migrating]. *Resistance from within the organization* [@Sneed2010ReMiP] is another factor influencing effort, with the unwillingness of staff to share knowledge and resistance towards change in general and new technologies, in particular, requiring good communication of the necessity and benefits of modernization [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization]. According to Gartner, "Cultural issues are at the root of many failed business transformations" [@Gartner2016Culture].

Modernizing legacy systems involves high *risk* [@ISO/IEEE24765Vocabulary;@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization;@Canfora2000Decomposing;@Bisbal1999LegacyInformationSystems;@Seacord2003ModernizingLS;@Heil2018ReWaMP]. Uncertainty of success makes companies hesitant to start projects. The risk of failure in modernization projects is high [@Gartner2014ModernizationFailure;@ForresterResearch2011Modernization] due to feasibility threats like lack of experienced staff for modernization itself [@Sneed2010SoftwareMigration;@Seacord2003ModernizingLS] and for web development and due to the complexity of the legacy system [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization].
Modernization poses the risk of *loss of knowledge* [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization].
Existing legacy systems represent valuable knowledge about business processes, rules, etc. [@Aversano2001;@Sneed2010SoftwareMigration;@Wagner2014Fundamentals] often resulting from years of requirements elicitation and experience. However, similar to *tacit knowledge* in organizations which is not expressed explicitly but guides human behavior [@Nonaka2008TacitKnowledge], the knowledge in legacy systems is not explicitly documented but governs how they operate. Thus, modernization bears the risk of losing this valuable knowledge [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization]. *Desirability* of modernization can be uncertain for companies because it is difficult to predict the acceptance of the new system by customers, the utility and usability of a web-based solution and the overall Return on Invest (ROI) [@Khadka2014ProfessionalsModernization].

Similar to [@Razavian2013PHD] for SOA Migration, we observed that web migration is considered sufficiently addressed in academia, but practitioners still face difficulties to commence a web migration project. Surveys show that the majority of the industry does not use academic resources for modernization [@Batlajery2014IndustrialSurveyModernization]. Many existing migration approaches do not sufficiently address the above problems by supporting companies in the initial phase (cf. analysis of phase support in our survey [@Heil2017Survey]), often assuming that the decision to modernize is already taken.

## Scope {#sec:scope}

Thus, this thesis is dedicated to the research question:

**Research Question RQ1**

> How to support software companies to commence web migration?

This guiding *central research question* [@Creswell2014ResearchDesign] was used for ideation using the *How Might We* method from the Human-Centered Design (HCD) design kit [@HCD2015] as described in detail in section [@sec:research-process]
The re-formulation of RQ1 into "*How might we support companies to commence web migration?*" has helped us create a solution consisting of the three core contributions as outlined in the following. RQ1 defines the scope of this thesis. The following related research questions are considered out of its scope:

- The thesis does not consider purely technical transformations between programming languages. While there is a large body of work available in the field of program transformation, fully automatic transformation on the code level [cf. family F1 in @Razavian2013PHD] has shown not sufficient for complex real-world systems when also a change of the basic paradigm is involved, e.g., from procedural to object-oriented [@Sneed2010SoftwareMigration], which is valid for web migration. Instead, reengineering [@ISO/IEEE24765Vocabulary;@IEEE1219Maintenance] supported by tools and knowledge extracted from the legacy system is required. 
- Database Migration is a related but distinct field of research with a large body of research focusing on migration from Relational to NoSQL databases [@Karnitis2015;@Zhao2014a;@Rocha2015RelationalNoSQL] in particular in the context of Cloud [@Strauch2013], from databases to XML [@Li2014;@Tzvetkov2005] and to Semantic Web [@Vavliakis2013;@Vavliakis2011;@XuanFan2010]. Unlike, e.g. changes in the user interface, these modernizations, are not a necessary consequence or pre-requisite of web migration. If they have to be undertaken, this should not be done at the same time as web migration. This thesis focuses only on modernizations that are required by the change into a web-based environment.
- This thesis does not address the modernization of business processes [cf. ADM Business Domain modernization@Perez-Castillo2011KDM; and family F3 in @Razavian2013PHD]. While the thesis does address the business perspective of web migration by supporting migration decision making and therefore changes in the business model, changes in business processes in order to optimize them or align them for a service-oriented architecture [@Razavian2013PHD;@Razavian2010SAPIENSA;@Nguyen2009] are not addressed. Optimization of business processes represents a modernization that is not a consequence or pre-requisite of web migration and should, therefore, be conducted separately. A SOA is not the specific target architecture of this thesis, and therefore business process modifications towards SOA are not addressed.
- Technical Debt is part of the motivation of this thesis as it constitutes an important reason why legacy systems need to be modernized, but this thesis does not directly address its identification [@Li2015TDSMS], estimation [@Curtis2012EstimatingTD] and management [@Yli-Huumo2016TD;@Li2015TDSMS]. The methodology presented in this thesis does indirectly affect technical debt in two ways. The knowledge recovery reduces technical debt by identification and management of valuable knowledge from the legacy system, facilitating program understanding for maintenance and reducing the risk of changing the code. The web migration per se introduces a change of technology towards open web standards replacing legacy technology which is part of technical debt [@Yli-Huumo2016TD]. These two indirect effects are a consequence of the overlap of Web Migration with modernization. An overview of research directly addressing Technical Debt can be found in [@Li2015TDSMS].

[@fig:modernization-migration] shows Web Migration, Software Modernization and their relation to the above out-of-scope topics.

## Contributions

To answer RQ1, we define an approach for lowering the initial hurdle for commencing a web migration project by providing processes, models, and tools that address the initial fears and resistance outlined above.
This approach is AWSM (Agile Web Migration for SMEs) [@Heil2016AWSM]. AWSM provides three core contributions:

- AWSM allows to identify and maintain existing valuable knowledge through crowdsourced concept assignment supported by a web-based annotation platform.
- AWSM minimizes risk through migration pilots and demonstrates desirability and feasibility of a potential web-based version of the legacy system applying the rapid prototyping paradigm to web migration.
- AWSM allows controlling the impact of web migration on customers through measuring visible changes.

## Structure of this Thesis

The rest of this thesis is organized as follows: [@sec:requirements-analysis] introduces a motivation scenario based on experience from a three-years industrial research project in the context of which the research presented in this thesis was conducted, and it elicits six requirements based on scenario and stakeholder characteristics. In [@sec:sota], the state of the art in the field of web migration is reviewed with regard to the requirements and shortcomings of existing approaches are discussed. [@sec:solution] reports on the design method and research process of the solution presented in this thesis. Based on systematic, detailed problem analysis, the solution and research design are derived, and an overview of the principles, formalisms, and methods of the AWSM Methodology and tools of the AWSM Platform is given. The following three chapters are dedicated to the techniques and tools of the three methods of the AWSM Methodology. [@sec:awsm-re] describes the reverse engineering method based on concept assignment that allows to recover and manage valuable knowledge in legacy codebases integrated with ongoing development processes and environment and supported by crowdsourcing. [@sec:awsm-rm] presents the risk management method based on rapid prototyping which enables to quickly demonstrate feasibility and desirability of a web-based version of the legacy system with limited resources and web engineering expertise supported by a guided transformation process. [@sec:awsm-ci] provides the customer impact method based on visual user interface analysis that facilitates the computation of measurements estimating the perceptual empirical similarity between legacy and web user interface tailored to the characteristics of the target user group to control customer impact of web migration. The overall evaluation is reported in [@sec:evaluation]. [@sec:conclusion] summarizes the contributions of this thesis and concludes with indications of further research directions.

## Summary

This chapter has introduced Web Systems in general and Web Applications in particular as widely used and accepted software solutions due to their advantages over traditional desktop software. It motivated the thesis by showing that any modernization of existing legacy systems is hard due to their specific characteristics. In spite of the notion that Web Migration is sufficiently addressed in academia, many companies are still struggling to commence Web Migration due to concerns about effort and risk and dedicated approaches addressing these concerns in the initial phases of Web Migration are scarce. From this, the central research question of this thesis, "How to support software companies to commence web migration?", was derived and the scope of this thesis was defined. The chapter provided an outline of the main research contributions and the structure of the thesis. The following chapter further explores the defined problem domain through analysis of a motivation scenario and elicitation of requirements for a suitable web migration approach addressing RQ1.
