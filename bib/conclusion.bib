abstract = {Migration of legacy systems to more advanced technologies and platforms is a current issue for many software organizations. Model-Driven Modernization combined with Software as a Service delivery model is a very promising approach, which possesses a lot of advantages, including reduced costs, automation of migration activities and reuse of system functionality. However, a drawback of such an innovative modernization approach is that it lacks mature software process models to guide its adoption. Thus, a methodology for seamless execution of different migration and deployment activities is quite needed. On the other hand, agile development methods have been successfully adopted in various projects, which partly or thoroughly use the engineering and delivery models exploited in the modernization process. This paper presents how a particular methodology for Model-Driven Modernization with deployment to the Cloud is enriched with agile techniques to address different challenging issues. The extended agile methodology could be used by organizations which have already applied agile software development as well as by organizations that plan to introduce it in their work. Keywords-},

@article{Ren2017Faster-RCNN,
abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

@article{Grigera2017,
abstract = {Usability assessment of web applications continues to be an expensive and often neglected practice. While large companies are able to spare resources for studying and improving usability in their products, smaller businesses often divert theirs in other aspects. To help these cases, researches have devised automatic approaches for user interaction analysis, and there are commercial services that offer automated usability statistics at relatively low fees. However, most existing approaches still fall short in specifying the usability problems concretely enough to identify and suggest solutions. In this work we describe usability smells of user interaction, i.e., hints of usability problems on running web applications, and the process in which they can be identified by analyzing user interaction events. We also describe USF, the tool that implements the process in a fully automated way with minimum setup effort. USF analyses user interaction events on-the-fly, discovers usability smells and reports them together with a concrete solution in terms of a usability refactoring, providing usability advice for deployed web applications.},

abstract = {Legacy systems are business-critical and contain valuable knowledge gathered over years of development. Many of these systems are still non-web desktop applications. Companies are aware of the advantages of web applications. However, Web Migration (WM), i.e. transforming legacy systems into web applications, is still a challenge, in particular for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). A large body of research exists in this field, but the specifics of SMEs have been overseen so far. This survey provides an overview on existing WM approaches with a dedicated focus on the SME perspective. The systematic mapping study analyses 122 primary studies and tools, identifies four major research focuses, reports on common methods and techniques and the consideration of SMEs. We then outline resulting research issues and future research directions.},
