In this paper we introduce the idea of Crowdsourced Reverse Engineering and identify the three major challenges: 1) automatic task extraction, 2) source code anonymization and 3) quality control and results aggregation. To illustrate Crowdsourced Reverse Engineering, we outline our approach for performing the Reverse Engineering activity of concept assignment as a crowdsourced classification task and address suitable methods and considerations with regard to each of the the three challenges. Following a brief overview on existing research in which we position our approach against related work, we report on our experiences from an experiment conducted on the crowdsourcing platform microworkers.com, which yielded 187 results by 34 crowd workers, classifying 10 code fragments with decent quality.},

abstract = {This article details the idea of Crowdsourced Reverse Engi- neering (CSRE) by analysing three major challenges: 1) automatic task extraction, 2) source code anonymization and 3) results aggregation and quality control. We re-formulate the Reverse Engineering activity of con- cept assignment as a crowdsourced classification task to exemplify these challenges and describe suitable methods to address them. Our overview on existing research of crowdsourcing showcases examples of successful application in the field of Software Engineering and argues that Re- verse Engineering activities like Concept Assignment are likely to also benefit from crowdsourcing by determining a high similarity in eight crowdsourcing dimensions to the microtasking model. Our experiments on the crowdsourcing platform microworkers.com support this, produc- ing 187 results by 34 crowd workers which classified 10 code fragments with decent quality. We provide an extended analysis of the observed crowd workers' behavior and report evidence of surprisingly high levels of engagement and efforts undertaken by the crowd. Concluding our ex- periences, this article indicates three open research challenges for future work.},

Our approach is designed to support developers as well as non-technical end-users in composing data-driven web interfaces in a plug-n-play manner. To enable this, we introduce the notion of crowdsourced web site components whose design can gradually evolve as they get associated with more data and functionality contributed by the crowd. Hence, required components must not necessarily pre-exist or be developed by the application designer alone, but can also be created on-demand by publishing an open call to the crowd that may in response provide multiple alternative solutions. The potential of the approach is illustrated based on two initial experiments.},

abstract = {Integrating legacy Cobol systems into a Web-based architecture is a complex and challenging task. Cobol is not a distributed and object-oriented language, however its integration with other languages or distributed systems is a prerequisite for achieving migration towards Web technologies. Moreover, the user interface and user interaction modalities need to be changed. Numerous strategies have been proposed for wrapping the business logic and re-implementing the user interface, but there is still a great need for experimental research. This paper presents a migration strategy whose target system is a Web-enabled architecture based on the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. By extracting all the needed information from the Cobol source code, the realized toolkit can automatically generate wrappers for the business logic and the data model and the Web user interface as Java server pages. The strategy and the toolkit presented have been defined within the project M{\&}S SW, a research project aimed at defining new technological solutions to be transferred to small and medium enterprises operating in information and communication technologies.},

@article{Perez-Castillo2011MARBLE,
abstract = {Context: Legacy information systems age over time. These systems cannot be thrown away because they store a significant amount of valuable business knowledge over time, and they cannot be entirely replaced at an acceptable cost. This circumstance is similar to that of the monuments of ancient civilizations, which have aged but still hold meaningful information about their civilizations. Evolutionary maintenance is the most suitable mechanism to deal with the software ageing problem since it preserves business knowledge. But first, recovering the underlying business knowledge in legacy systems is necessary in order to preserve this vital heritage. Objective: This paper proposes and validates a method for recovering and rebuilding business processes from legacy information systems. This method, which can be considered a business process archeology, makes it possible to preserve the business knowledge in legacy information systems. Method: The business process archeology method is framed in MARBLE, a generic framework based on Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM), which uses the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. The proposed method is validated using a case study that involves a real-life legacy system. The case study is conducted following the case study protocol proposed by Brereton et al. Results: The study reports that the proposed method makes it possible to obtain business process models from legacy systems with adequate levels of accuracy. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated positively. Conclusion: The proposed method semi-automatically rebuilds the hidden business processes embedded in a legacy system. Therefore, the business process archeology method quickly allows business experts to have a meaningful understanding of the organization's business processes.

@article{Ceccato2014,
abstract = {Context: code obfuscation is intended to obstruct code understanding and, eventually, to delay malicious code changes and ultimately render it uneconomical. Although code understanding cannot be completely impeded, code obfuscation makes it more laborious and troublesome, so as to discourage or retard code tampering. Despite the extensive adoption of obfuscation, its assessment has been addressed indirectly either by using internal metrics or taking the point of view of code analysis, e.g., considering the associated computational complexity. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available user study that measures the cost of understanding obfuscated code from the point of view of a human attacker. Aim: this paper experimentally assesses the impact of code obfuscation on the capability of human subjects to understand and change source code. In particular, it considers code protected with two well-known code obfuscation techniques, i.e., identifier renaming and opaque predicates. Method: We have conducted a family of five controlled experiments, involving undergraduate and graduate students from four Universities. During the experiments, subjects had to perform comprehension or attack tasks on decompiled clients of two Java network-based applications, either obfuscated using one of the two techniques, or not. To assess and compare the obfuscation techniques, we measured the correctness and the efficiency of the performed task. Results: —at least for the tasks we considered—simpler techniques (i.e., identifier renaming) prove to be more effective than more complex ones (i.e., opaque predicates) in impeding subjects to complete attack tasks.},

An example of a crosscutting concern is a functional requirement whose implementation is distributed across multiple software modules. We asked the question, "How much does the amount that a concern is crosscutting affect the number of defects in a program?" We conducted three extensive case studies to help answer this question. All three studies revealed a moderate to strong statistically significant correlation between the degree of scattering and the number of defects. This paper describes the experimental framework we developed to conduct the studies, the metrics we adopted and developed to measure the degree of scattering, the studies we performed, the efforts we undertook to remove experimental and other biases, and the results we obtained. In the process, we have formulated a theory that explains why increased scattering might lead to increased defects.},

abstract = {This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer project carried out in coopera- tion between the University of Salerno and a small software company. The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrial partner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacy systems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of the partner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decompos- ability with spaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the user interface descriptions. For this reason, it was decided to adopt an incremental migration strategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology, on the transformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs, and the wrapping of the legacy programs. A middleware framework links the new Web-based user interface with the Wrapped Legacy System. An Eclipse plug-in, named MELIS (migration environment for legacy information systems), was also developed to support the migration process. Both the migration strategy and the tool have been applied to two essential subsystems of the most business critical legacy system of the partner company.

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application},

Model-Driven Modernization combined with Software as a Service delivery model is a very promising approach, which possesses a lot of advantages, including reduced costs, automation of migration activities and reuse of system functionality. However, a drawback of such an innovative modernization approach is that it lacks mature software process models to guide its adoption. Thus, a methodology for seamless execution of different migration and deployment activities is quite needed. On the other hand, agile development methods have been successfully adopted in various projects, which partly or thoroughly use the engineering and delivery models exploited in the modernization process. This paper presents how a particular methodology for Model-Driven Modernization with deployment to the Cloud is enriched with agile techniques to address different challenging issues.

abstract = {Service-oriented architectures (SOA) offer a suitable solution to manage the continuous changes in companies business processes. SOA facilitates the alignment of business process with underlying system services. There is a high percentage of Legacy Web Applications (LWA) developed by software factories that were implemented by using Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks and without considering SOA in their development process. In this context, many companies are performing a modernization of their systems to be adapted to SOA. However, this migration is usually carried out ad-hoc by means of not reusable and error-prone manual processes. Additionally, these migration processes are often performed at a low abstraction level, close to code, hindering reusability and maintainability of the obtained systems. In this paper a Model-Driven systematic and semi-automatic approach to modernizelegacy web applications to SOA is presented. The approacheases the reutilization of the process at different domains, since the underlying services of the LWA are identified andgenerated from model-driven techniques, but also of the newgenerated system since these new services may be offered asan interoperable service layer. Although the paper completely introduces the approach, it mainly focuses on the semantic process defined to discover services of the LWA that may be later associated (aligned) to the company business processes.},

This allows companies to leverage the potential of the crowd, a flexible on-demand workforce, by seamless integration of suitable experts into the software development process. Software developers working in loosely coupled and open team structures need to be supported to efficiently collaborate by providing them with the necessary tool chain. Since the management of software projects incorporating the crowd poses new challenges to project managers, we also discuss approaches that help to manage such projects and to ensure a high-quality software product.},

We present CrowdAdapt—a context-aware web design tool that supports developers in the creation of adaptive layout solutions for a wide variety of use contexts by crowdsourcing web site adaptations designed for individ- ual viewing conditions and preferences. We focus on one ex- periment we conducted for an existing news web site using CrowdAdapt (i) to explore the design space in terms of lay- out alternatives created by the crowd, (ii) to identify adapta- tion preferences with respect to different viewing situations, and (iii) to assess the perceived quality of crowd-generated layouts in terms of reading comfort and efficiency. The re- sults suggest that crowdsourced adaptation could lead to very flexible web interfaces informed by individual end-user re-quirements. In particular, scenarios such as the adaptation to large-screen contexts that the majority of web sites fail to address could be supported with relatively little effort.},

@article{Canfora2000Decomposing,
abstract = {A solution to the problem of salvaging the past investments in centralized, mainframe-oriented software development, while keeping competitive in the dynamic business world, consists of migrating legacy systems towards more modern environments, in particular client-server platforms. However, a migration process entails costs and risks that depend on the characteristics of both the architecture of the source system and the target client-server platform. We propose an approach to program decomposition as a preliminary step for the migration of legacy systems. A program slicing algorithm is defined to identify the statements implementing the user interface component. An interactive re-engineering tool is also presented that supports the software engineer in the comprehension of the source code during the decomposition of a program. The focus of this paper is on the partition of a legacy system, while issues related to the re-engineering, encapsulation, and wrapping of the legacy components and to the definition of the middleware layer through which they communicate are not tackled.},

@article{Storey2009,
abstract = {When one imagines a reverse engineer at work, an image that often comes to mind is that of a lone engineer using advanced tools to help in design recovery. However, in practice the engineer may be part of a team that has to tackle the arduous task of documenting a system's design. Often, such a team will be distributed and may have to work in an asynchronous manner. Moreover, sharing and combining knowledge will transient or non-team members further adds to the complexity of the task. These collaboration challenges are seldom discussed or even mentioned in the research literature. In this talk, I will explore how models, theories and technologies from the disciplines of computer supported cooperative work and social computing can improve and encourage collaboration in reverse engineering. I will briefly present several success stories on how social computing technologies have helped improve how small teams, distributed larger teams and the crowd tackle complex intellectual tasks in other areas of science. I will also describe some of our early work investigating how Web 2.0 social computing technologies, such as tagging and feeds facilitate collaborative software engineering. My hope is that these stories may spark ideas on how social computing might inspire new research in reverse engineering.},

It requires a huge amount of time-, man power- as well as financial resources. The challenges are size, seniority and heterogeneity of those software systems. Christian Wagner addresses software evolution: the inherent problems and uncertainties in the process. He presents a model-driven method which leads to a synchronization between source code and design. As a result the model layer will be the central part in further evolution and source code becomes a by-product. For the first time a model-driven procedure for maintenance and migration of software systems is described. The procedure is composed of a model-driven reengineering and a model-driven migration phase. The application and effectiveness of the procedure are confirmed with a reference implementation applied to four exemplary systems.},

@article{Stroulia2002DynamicAnalysis,
abstract = {The main focus of program understanding and reverse engineering research has been on modeling the structure of a program by examining its code. This has been the result of the nature of the systems investigated and the perceived goals of the reverse engineering activities. The types of systems under investigation have changed, however, and the maintenance objectives have evolved. Many legacy systems today are object-oriented and component-based. One of the most prominent maintenance objectives is system migration to distributed environments, most notably the World Wide Web, for interoperation with other systems. This new maintenance objective has a great impact on the types of models expected as products of reverse engineering. As the traditional static software analysis techniques keep their valuable role in program comprehension, additional techniques, especially those focusing on run-time analysis of the subject systems, become equally important. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of the system's dynamic behavior, as it pertains to understanding the system's processes and uses. We give an overview of currently used dynamic reverse engineering techniques and identify some challenges yet to be tackled.},

@article{Pennington1987Mental,
abstract = {Comprehension of computer programs involves detecting or inferring different kinds of relations between program parts. Different kinds of programming knowledge facilitate detection and representation of the different textual relations. The present research investigates the role of programming knowledge in program comprehension and the nature of mental representations of programs; specifically, whether procedural (control flow) or functional (goal hierarchy) relations dominate programmers' mental representations of programs. In the first study, 80 professional programmers were tested on comprehension and recognition of short computer program texts. The results suggest that procedural rather than functional units form the basis of expert programmers' mental representations, supporting work in other areas of text comprehension showing the importance of text structure knowledge in understanding. In a second study 40 professional programmers studied and modified programs of moderate length. Results support conclusions from the first study that programs are first understood in terms of their procedural episodes. However, results also suggest that a programmer's task goals may influence the relations that dominate mental representations later in comprehension. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

@inproceedings{Stol2014,
abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an emerging and promising approach which involves delegating a variety of tasks to an unknown workforce - the crowd. Crowdsourcing has been applied quite successfully in various contexts from basic tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk to solving complex industry problems, e.g. InnoCentive. Companies are increasingly using crowdsourcing to accomplish specific software development tasks. However, very little research exists on this specific topic. This paper presents an in-depth industry case study of crowdsourcing software development at a multinational corporation. Our case study highlights a number of challenges that arise when crowdsourcing software development. For example, the crowdsourcing development process is essentially a waterfall model and this must eventually be integrated with the agile approach used by the company. Crowdsourcing works better for specific software development tasks that are less complex and stand-alone without interdependencies. The development cost was much greater than originally expected, overhead in terms of company effort to prepare specifications and answer crowdsourcing community queries was much greater, and the time-scale to complete contests, review submissions and resolve quality issues was significant. Finally, quality issues were pushed later in the lifecycle given the lengthy process necessary to identify and resolve quality issues. Given the emphasis in software engineering on identifying bugs as early as possible, this is quite problematic.},

@article{Daniel2018CrowdsourcingQuality,
abstract = {Crowdsourcing enables one to leverage on the intelligence and wisdom of potentially large groups of individuals toward solving problems. Common problems approached with crowdsourcing are labeling images, translating or transcribing text, providing opinions or ideas, and similar - all tasks that computers are not good at or where they may even fail altogether. The introduction of humans into computations and/or everyday work, however, also poses critical, novel challenges in terms of quality control, as the crowd is typically composed of people with unknown and very diverse abilities, skills, interests, personal objectives and technological resources. This survey studies quality in the context of crowdsourcing along several dimensions, so as to define and characterize it and to understand the current state of the art. Specifically, this survey derives a quality model for crowdsourcing tasks, identifies the methods and techniques that can be used to assess the attributes of the model, and the actions and strategies that help prevent and mitigate quality problems. An analysis of how these features are supported by the state of the art further identifies open issues and informs an outlook on hot future research directions.},

Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether practitioners in the industry also share this perception. This paper describes the outcome of an exploratory study in which 26 industrial practitioners were interviewed on what makes a software system a legacy system, what the main drivers are that lead to the modernization of such systems, and what challenges are faced during the modernization process. The findings of the interviews have been validated by means of a survey with 198 respondents. The results show that practitioners value their legacy systems highly, the challenges they face are not just technical, but also include business and organizational aspects.},
