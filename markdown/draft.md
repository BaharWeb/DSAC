Problem statement

-   Making a transition from non-web legacy systems to web is desirable
    for companies

-   BUT: Commencing web migration is hard

    -   Effort

        -   High effort (TODO: Distinguish Big Bang/Incremental
            [@Distante2006]reports 12+PM for one project, [@Bernhart2012]18+ PM for
            incremental approach, [@Aversano2001] 8PM, [@Maenhaut2015] reports about 14 PM
            for two projects), not only including direct development,
            but also training for users etc.

        -   Hard to estimate, cf. Corrective Maintenance Estimation
            [@Singh2015EffortEstimation] and difficult to predict the ROI [@Khadka2014]

    -   Risk

        -   Uncertainty of success/risk of failure due to feasibility
            threats (staff not trained in migration, not trained in web
            development, LS typically complex)

        -   Uncertainty of desirability (acceptance by customers,
            usability of web-based solution)

-   (Existing migration approaches assume decision to migrate is taken
    already)

-   Existing migration approaches do not support initial phase

    -   Cf. phase support from [@Heil2017Survey]

Question

-   How to support companies (SMEs?) to commence web migration

Solution

-   Define web migration process addressing initial fears/resistance

-   Risk minimization through migration pilots (prototypes)

-   Demonstrate desirability and feasibility of web version of legacy
    system

-   Identify and maintain existing valuable knowledge through concept
    assignment platform (annotation platform?)

-   Apply rapid prototyping to web migration

-   Control impact of web migration on customers through measuring
    visible changes

Contributions

-   Decision Support System for SMEs

-   Concept Assignment Process integrated into development and Platform

-   Rapid Migration Prototyping

-   Similarity Metrics for non-web and web UIs

State of the Art
================

Requirements

-   (original Medatixx process requirements 2015)

    -   Existing staff, expertise

    -   Integration into development process

    -   Incremental

    -   Cost and Time efficient

    -   Tool support

-   Support for initial phase

        -   (MockAPI [@Rivero2013MockAPI]/ELECTRA [@Rivero2014Electra] /) MockupDD [@Rivero2013MockupDD]

Problem

-   Migration approaches do not address initial phase [@Heil2017Survey]

-   Migration approaches do not consider SMEs? [@Heil2017Survey]

-   Web Engineering approaches start from scratch, not from legacy

    -   Requirements Elicitation vs Re-Discovery of Requirements

-   Lack of consideration of impact on existing users

Current Solutions

-   TODO: mention Decision Support System for SMEs as contribution
    resulting from [@Heil2017Survey]

-   General Software Migration Approaches

-   Web Engineering Approaches

    -   MDWE

-   Web Migration Approaches

    -   to SOA

    -   to Cloud

    -   Web Systems Evolution

    -   to Web

Answer -- clear stakeholder, scenario/problem

-   Stakeholder: Software Companies (SMEs?) with legacy, non-web,
    desktop applications and large existing user bases

-   Stakeholder Problem: initial hurdle to commence a web migration due
    to doubts about feasibility and desirability

Solution
========

Stakeholder-specific situation

Cf. LFA Problem Tree Analysis from EHRL

-   Software Companies (SMEs) are hesitant to commence a web migration
    because of doubts about feasibility and desirability

-   Feasibility Doubts

    -   Technical: possibility of implementation as web application

    -   Human-Resources: lack of staff with web engineering expertise

    -   Process Integration: limited human resources and problems of
        integrating with ongoing software development process

-   Desirability

    -   Loss of knowledge: risk of losing knowledge

    -   Customers: risk of losing customers because of changed UIX

    -   Advantages: lack of concrete evidence of advantages of a web
        based version

Existing Technologies

-   HCD, Agile Development: Rapid Prototyping

-   Reverse Engineering: Concept Assignment [@Biggerstaff1994ConceptAssignmentJournal], [@Biggerstaff1994ConceptAssignmentICSE]

    legacy systems?

Identification and Management of knowledge in legacy systems
============================================================

Situation

-   Legacy systems contain valuable problem and solution domain
    knowledge

Existing Technologies

-   Reverse Engineering

    -   Re-documentation

    -   Concept Assignment

        -   "will never be completely automated", but "some useful
            automation is possible" [@Biggerstaff1994ConceptAssignmentJournal]

        -   Two step process: 1 "Identify which entities and relations
            ... are really important" 2 "Assign them to known (or newly
            discovered) domain concepts and relations" [@Biggerstaff1994ConceptAssignmentJournal]

Problem

-   No/poor legacy artifacts: documentation, models, requirements

-   Existing re-documentation approaches focus on solution domain
    knowledge

-   Manual re-documentation is time-consuming & cannot be easily
    integrated into daily software development and maintenance

Question

-   How to identify and manage problem and solution domain knowledge in
    legacy systems?

Solution

-   Concept Assignment with AWSM Platform [@Heil2016AWSM]

Rapid Web Migration Prototyping
===============================

Situation

-   Rapid Prototyping is used in early stages of Web Engineering to
    address desirability, feasibility

Existing Technologies

-   Rapid Prototyping in Web Engineering

Problem

-   Web Migration differs from forward Web Engineering

-   Rapid Prototyping has to be adapted to Web Migration Context

Question

-   How to apply Rapid Prototyping in Web Migration

Solution

-   ReWaMP Process [@Heil2018ReWaMP]

-   UI Generation

-   API Generation (MockAPI) [@Rivero2013MockAPI] [@Rivero2014Electra] (1 Journal in progress )

![](../figures/image15.png){width="4.804166666666666in"

Similarity of User Interfaces in Web and non-Web contexts
=========================================================

Situation

-   Legacy system user base is familiar with and well-adapted to legacy
    user interface

-   Web Migration visibly impacts the user interface

Existing Technologies

-   General Image Similarity Metrics

-   DOM-based UI Analysis

Problem

-   Changes due to Web Migration risk losing users

-   Learning the new Web User Interface requires effort

-   Existing UI similarity approaches cannot be applied to legacy and
    web UIs because they are based on code analysis

Question

-   How to measure the similarity of non-web and web versions of a user
    interface

Solution

-   Similarity Analysis based on visual aspects [@Heil2016Similarity] [@Bakaev2017WebIntelligence] [@Bakaev2017Kansei]

Evaluation

-   Experimental Evaluation with UI pairs and test subjects [@Heil2016Similarity]
    [@Bakaev2017WebIntelligence] [@Bakaev2017Kansei]
